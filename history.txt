# Question : what is object oriented programming
# Answer : **Object-Oriented Programming** is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using **classes** and **objects**. It simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some concepts defined below.

# Question : what is inheritance
# Answer : **Inheritance** is a process in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of its parent object automatically. In such a way, you can reuse, extend or modify the attributes and behaviors which are defined in other classes.

# Question : give me an example of inheritance
# Answer : **Inheritance Example**

Here is an example of inheritance in C++:
```
class Base_class {
  public:
    virtual void show() {
      cout << "Apni Kaksha base" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived_class : public Base_class {
  public:
    void show() {
      cout << "Apni Kaksha derived" << endl;
    }
};
```
In this example, `Derived_class` is the **derived class** that inherits from the **base class** `Base_class`. The `Derived_class` overrides the `show()` method of the `Base_class`.

# Question : now tell me about DBMS
# Answer : **Database Management System (DBMS)** is a software for storing and retrieving users' data while considering appropriate security measures. It consists of a group of programs which manipulate the database. The DBMS accepts the request for data from an application and instructs the operating system to provide the specific data. In large systems, a DBMS helps users and other third-party software to store and retrieve data.

DBMS was developed to handle the following difficulties of typical File-processing systems supported by conventional operating systems.

# Question : what is entity relationship diagram, why is it necessary to create
# Answer : **ER Diagram** is a conceptual model that gives the **graphical representation** of the **logical structure** of the database. It is necessary to create an ER diagram to:
* Show all the **constraints** and **relationships** that exist among the different components.
* Graphically represent the **logical structure** of the database.
* Identify the **Entity Sets**, **Attributes**, and **Relationship Set** in the database.

# Question : What is ER diagram in DBMS
# Answer : **ER diagram** or **Entity Relationship diagram** is a conceptual model that gives the graphical representation of the logical structure of the database. It shows all the constraints and relationships that exist among the different components. An ER diagram is mainly composed of following three components- **Entity Sets**, **Attributes** and **Relationship Set**.

# Question : What are joins in SQL
# Answer : **Joins** in SQL are used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
--------------------------------------------------

[2025-06-29 19:15:39]
# Question : Tell me the types of JOINS in SQL
# Answer : - **INNER JOIN**: selects records that have matching values in both tables.
- **FULL (OUTER) JOIN**: returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.
