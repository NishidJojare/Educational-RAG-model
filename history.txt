# Question : what is object oriented programming
# Answer : **Object-Oriented Programming** is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using **classes** and **objects**. It simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some concepts defined below.

# Question : what is inheritance
# Answer : **Inheritance** is a process in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of its parent object automatically. In such a way, you can reuse, extend or modify the attributes and behaviors which are defined in other classes.

# Question : give me an example of inheritance
# Answer : **Inheritance Example**

Here is an example of inheritance in C++:
```
class Base_class {
  public:
    virtual void show() {
      cout << "Apni Kaksha base" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived_class : public Base_class {
  public:
    void show() {
      cout << "Apni Kaksha derived" << endl;
    }
};
```
In this example, `Derived_class` is the **derived class** that inherits from the **base class** `Base_class`. The `Derived_class` overrides the `show()` method of the `Base_class`.

* **Linear SVM Classification**
* **K-Means** (Lloyd-Forgy algorithm)
* **Logistic Regression**
* **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**
* **Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)**
* **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**
* **Gradient Descent**
* **LeNet-5**

Note that this is not an exhaustive list of all machine learning algorithms, but rather a selection of algorithms mentioned in the provided context.

# Question : now tell me about DBMS
# Answer : **Database Management System (DBMS)** is a software for storing and retrieving users' data while considering appropriate security measures. It consists of a group of programs which manipulate the database. The DBMS accepts the request for data from an application and instructs the operating system to provide the specific data. In large systems, a DBMS helps users and other third-party software to store and retrieve data.

DBMS was developed to handle the following difficulties of typical File-processing systems supported by conventional operating systems.

# Question : what is entity relationship diagram, why is it necessary to create
# Answer : **ER Diagram** is a conceptual model that gives the **graphical representation** of the **logical structure** of the database. It is necessary to create an ER diagram to:
* Show all the **constraints** and **relationships** that exist among the different components.
* Graphically represent the **logical structure** of the database.
* Identify the **Entity Sets**, **Attributes**, and **Relationship Set** in the database.
